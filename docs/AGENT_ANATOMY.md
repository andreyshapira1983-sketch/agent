# Agent Anatomy

Grouped module index for the `core/` package, organized by the
architecture sections (§1–§12). Modules physically live flat in `core/`
— their paths are used as semantic identifiers elsewhere (planner
self-build targets, locators, audits), so this map groups them
*logically* without moving files.

Kept in sync with the codebase by `scripts/agent_anatomy_check.py`
(read-only drift check, TD-029). Regenerate with
`python scripts/gen_anatomy.py` whenever a module is added or removed.

_Total: 108 modules across 12 groups._
